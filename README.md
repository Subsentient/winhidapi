# winhidapi
Heavily cleaned up and stability improved hidapi converted to C++14 -- just for Windows. Supports both MinGW and MSVC 2019 compilers.

Authored and maintained by me, Subsentient, but also used by my employer, Sonoran Video Systems, in our Coyote playback products.

This repo is not abandoned, because if something breaks, we'll notice in our products and fix it here. That said, do not expect regular commit activity.

Feel free to contact me if you need help with winhidapi or have an issue/bug report/feature request.
